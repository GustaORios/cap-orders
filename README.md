# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

File or Folder | Purpose
---------|----------
`app/` | Fiori Elements APP
`db/` | Database with entities
`srv/` | Expose entities in a service and custom handlers
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide


## Next Steps

Mock data : move folder "data" to inside "db" folder
- Open a new terminal and run `cds watch` 
- (in VS Code simply choose _**Terminal** > Run Task > cds watch_)
- Start adding content, for example, a [db/data-model.cds](db/data-model.cds).
